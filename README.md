At the end of this Mini Project, you will be able to :

have a fair understanding of A/B Testing - a statistical way to compare two or more versions (A or B?)

determine not only which one (A or B) performs better but also understand if the difference between two of them is statistically significant

derive meaningful insights from the formula for Confidence Intervals with the t-distribution and how to adjust this formula using the Central Limit Theorem

know the dependent 3 factors (Power of the test, Significance level & Minimal Desired Effect) for having a required Sample Size

carry out Binomial Proportion Confidence Intervals, 2-sample Z-test and Chi-square. The objective of this mini project is to serve as an introductory guide to A/B testing, 
covering foundational concepts and methodologies.
